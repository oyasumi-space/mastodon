        setting_default_searchability: On kmyblue and Fedibird, the search is based on the search permission setting; on Misskey, all public, local public, and non-public posts are searched regardless of this setting; on Mastodon and Firefish, instead of search permission, the "Make public posts freely searchable on other servers" setting in the profile settings is applied. In Mastodon and Firefish, the "Make public posts freely searchable on other servers" setting in the profile settings is applied instead of the search permission.

        setting_reject_send_limited_to_suspects: This applies to "Mutual Only" posts. Circle posts will be delivered without exception. Some Misskey servers have independently supported limited posting, but this is a setting for those who are concerned about it, as mutual-only posting exposes some of the users you are mutual with to Misskey users!
        setting_reject_unlisted_subscription: Misskey and its forks can **subscribe and search** for "non-following" posts from accounts they do not follow. This differs from kmyblue's behavior. It delivers posts in the specified public range to such servers as "followers only". Please understand, however, that due to its structure, it is difficult to handle perfectly and will occasionally be delivered as non-subscribed.
        setting_reverse_search_quote: Double-quotes will result in a search with a wider range of notation, which is the opposite of Mastodon's default behavior.

        whole_word: When the keyword or phrase is alphanumeric only, it will only be applied if it matches the whole word
      domain_allow:
        domain: This domain will be able to fetch data from this server and incoming data from it will be processed and stored

        with_dns_records: An attempt to resolve the given domain's DNS records will be made and the results will also be blocked

        closed_registrations_message: Displayed when sign-ups are closed
        content_cache_retention_period: All posts from other servers (including boosts and replies) will be deleted after the specified number of days, without regard to any local user interaction with those posts. This includes posts where a local user has marked it as bookmarks or favorites. Private mentions between users from different instances will also be lost and impossible to restore. Use of this setting is intended for special purpose instances and breaks many user expectations when implemented for general purpose use.
        custom_css: You can apply custom styles on the web version of Mastodon.
        delete_content_cache_without_reaction: This feature currently raises concerns about load. We anticipate the emergence of user bots that bookmark all posts. Please consider this carefully, especially on large servers.
        enable_local_timeline: While enabling this feature will allow for interaction between like-minded users, it may also strengthen the internal atmosphere; since Mastodon is supposed to have a local timeline, we recommend annotating it in the server introduction if it is to be disabled.
        enable_public_unlisted_visibility: If true, your community maybe closed-minded. If turn it false, strongly recommend that you disclose that you have disabled this setting!
        enable_public_visibility: If disabled, public posts will be forcibly replaced with "Local public" or "Unlisted" posts.

If the media data is requested after it is deleted, it will be re-downloaded, if the source content is still available. Due to restrictions on how often link preview cards poll third-party sites, it is recommended to set this value to at least 14 days, or link preview cards will not be updated on demand before that time.
        peers_api_enabled: A list of domain names this server has encountered in the fediverse. No data is included here about whether you federate with a given server, just that your server knows about it. This is used by services that collect statistics on federation in a general sense.
        profile_directory: The profile directory lists all users who have opted-in to be discoverable.
        receive_other_servers_emoji_reaction: It can cause load. It is recommended to enable it only when there are few people.
